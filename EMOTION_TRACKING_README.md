## How It Works

### Emotion Analysis Process

1. **Message Sent:** User sends a message
2. **AI Analysis:** Message is analyzed by Perplexity AI
3. **Emotion Detection:** Primary and secondary emotions identified
4. **Intensity Calculation:** Emotion strength measured (1-10)
5. **Sentiment Scoring:** Overall sentiment calculated (-1.0 to 1.0)
6. **Database Storage:** Emotion data saved to database
7. **Visual Update:** Background color and UI updated
8. **Pattern Detection:** System checks for emotional patterns

### AI-Powered Analysis

The system uses Perplexity AI for advanced emotion detection:

```javascript
// Example emotion analysis result
{
  primaryEmotion: "joy",
  intensity: 8,
  secondaryEmotions: [
    { emotion: "excitement", intensity: 6 },
    { emotion: "gratitude", intensity: 5 }
  ],
  sentimentScore: 0.85,
  triggerWords: ["happy", "wonderful", "love"],
  emotionalContext: "Expressing happiness and gratitude"
}
```

### Fallback Analysis

If AI is unavailable, the system uses keyword-based analysis:

- Pattern matching for emotion keywords
- Punctuation analysis (!, !!, ...)
- Capitalization detection
- Sentiment word counting
